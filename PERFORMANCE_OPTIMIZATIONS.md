# Performance Optimizations and Monitoring

This document summarizes the performance optimizations and monitoring capabilities implemented for the order book system.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Data Structure Optimizations

#### Order Book Engine
- **BTreeMap for Price Levels**: O(log n) price-ordered access for efficient best bid/ask queries
- **VecDeque for FIFO Queues**: O(1) insertion and removal for order matching
- **HashMap for Order Index**: O(1) order lookup for cancellations
- **Circular Buffers**: Bounded memory usage for time series data (spread history)

#### Memory Management
- **CircularBuffer<T>**: Memory-efficient storage for rolling time series data
- **OrderPool**: Object pooling to reduce allocation overhead (ready for implementation)
- **StringInterner**: Reduce memory usage for repeated strings
- **MemoryTracker**: Monitor system memory consumption

### 2. Performance Monitoring

#### Metrics Collection
- **Order Processing Metrics**: Latency, throughput, success/failure rates
- **Data Ingestion Metrics**: Event processing rates, error rates, parsing performance
- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory consumption, uptime
- **Business Metrics**: Trade generation, market data quality

#### Prometheus Integration
- Metrics exported on port 3001 (configurable)
- Comprehensive alerting rules for performance degradation
- Grafana dashboard configuration for visualization

### 3. Benchmarking Infrastructure

#### Criterion Benchmarks
- **Order Book Operations**: Placement, matching, cancellation performance
- **Data Ingestion**: CSV parsing, seeking, large file processing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Large order book memory usage patterns
- **Mixed Workloads**: Realistic trading scenarios

#### Performance Targets
- Order placement: < 10μs (95th percentile)
- Order cancellation: < 5μs (95th percentile)
- Snapshot generation: < 100μs (95th percentile)
- CSV event parsing: < 1μs per event
- Order processing: > 100,000 orders/second
- Data ingestion: > 1,000,000 events/second

### 4. Memory Optimizations

#### Bounded Growth
- Circular buffers prevent unbounded memory growth
- Configurable limits on time series data (default: 400 points)
- Efficient cleanup of empty price levels

#### Allocation Reduction
- Object pooling infrastructure for high-frequency allocations
- Reuse of data structures where possible
- Minimal allocations in hot paths

### 5. Data Ingestion Optimizations

#### Streaming Processing
- Memory-efficient CSV parsing without loading entire files
- Configurable playback speed for historical data replay
- Error handling that doesn't stop processing

#### Performance Monitoring
- Per-event processing time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Throughput measurement

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Latency Metrics**
   - Order placement latency (p50, p95, p99)
   - Order cancellation latency
   - Snapshot generation time

2. **Throughput Metrics**
   - Orders processed per second
   - Events ingested per second
   - Trades generated per second

3. **Error Rates**
   - Order failure rate
   - Data ingestion error rate
   - System error count

4. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory consumption
   - CPU utilization
   - Connection count

### Alerting Rules

- High latency alerts (>10ms for orders, >100ms for snapshots)
- Low throughput alerts (<1000 orders/sec)
- High error rates (>5% order failures, >1% ingestion errors)
- Resource exhaustion (>1GB memory, >80% CPU)

## Usage Instructions

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
./backend/scripts/run_benchmarks.sh

# Run specific benchmark
cargo bench --bench orderbook_benchmarks

# View results
open target/criterion/report/index.html
```

### Memory Profiling

```bash
# Run memory profiling
./backend/scripts/profile_memory.sh

# View memory usage report
cat memory_profile_report.md
```

### Monitoring Setup

1. **Start the server with metrics**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin serve --release
   ```

2. **Access metrics**:
   - Prometheus metrics: http://localhost:3001/metrics
   - Health check: http://localhost:3000/health

3. **Set up Prometheus** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Use provided configuration
   prometheus --config.file=backend/monitoring/prometheus.yml
   ```

4. **Import Grafana dashboard**:
   - Import `backend/monitoring/grafana_dashboard.json`

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Build optimized binary
cargo build --release

# Run with performance monitoring
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/serve --port 3000

# Monitor metrics in another terminal
curl http://localhost:3001/metrics
```

## Performance Tuning Recommendations

### For High-Frequency Trading
1. Use release builds with LTO (Link Time Optimization)
2. Pin CPU cores to avoid context switching
3. Increase system limits (file descriptors, memory)
4. Use dedicated hardware with low-latency networking

### For Large Datasets
1. Increase circular buffer sizes for longer history
2. Use memory-mapped files for very large CSV files
3. Implement data compression for storage
4. Consider sharding across multiple instances

### For Production Deployment
1. Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
2. Implement graceful degradation under load
3. Use load balancing for WebSocket connections
4. Regular performance regression testing
